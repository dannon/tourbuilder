Galaxy Tour Builder is a webextension which assists in the building of Galaxy
Tours.  Just toggle it on and click through the actions you'd like to record.

This web extension uses jquery and jquery-dompath.

Currently only chrome is supported. 

Anyway if you want to adapt it to firefox here are the first steps on how to 
install it. 

Temporary installation in Firefox: 
- open about:debugging 
- Load Temporary Add-on
- select any file in the directory
- (the extension will now be available until restart of firefox)

Creation of a permanent addon:
